#Observations: 
	-After doing some analysis on the data we had on Genders, we determined that males dominated the amount of purchases. 
	The company should target males over any other Gender while marketing. 
	- After doing some analysis on the ages of people who bought the game we have concluded that the ages between 20-24 will be target market. More people between the ages of 
	20-24 bought games than any other age group. 
	- After doing analysis on the average purchasing price of the upgrades we determine that the average purchase price was a little under $3 at $2.93.
	We also calculated that females averaged a $2.80 per purchase which means any time a female buys an upgrade it is typically under the average
